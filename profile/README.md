# Welcome to FoxServers

## Roadmap
[✓] Accounts page interacting with database\
[✓] Database interacting with Vanilla server\
[✓] Database interacting with Modded server\
[ ] Documentation (I know... I should have done this from the beginning)\
[?] 1.0 Release of server whitelist software using API Keys for access to our user database (or your own json file output from your own website)\
[?] 2.0 Release of full suite of software, including a gui? (Not anytime soon, the project needs to be stable first)

## Recent Updates
**Work has begun on server management software!**\
After a long hiatus I've finally resumed work on this project. Currently working on the core of 1.0 server mangement software. More updates to come...\

**Website 1.0 Release!**\
We have finally deployed whitelist scripts to a server, allowing it to have a database managed whitelist!!!\
For now I'm taking a bit of a break from development of the backend to test deployment on modded platforms and get caught up on documentation, but then its back on the grind to release a 1.0 version of the whitelist/server software once everything is stable. Then I enter the "2.0" phase of development, where I can hopefully make a "full suite" of software similar to the stuff I have created to run my own servers off a central database. Would be really cool to make a full "control center", but that's best saved for a future "3.0" or something...\
Either way, the project continues.
