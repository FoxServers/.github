# Welcome to FoxServers

## Roadmap
[✓] Accounts page interacting with database\
[✓] Database interacting with Vanilla server\
[✓] Database interacting with Modded server\
[ ] Documentation (I know... I should have done this from the beginning)\
[?] 1.0 Release of server whitelist software using API Keys for access to our user database (or your own json file output from your own website)\
[?] 2.0 Release of full suite of software, including a gui? (Not anytime soon, the project needs to be stable first)

## Recent Updates
**Repository Chaos**\
Lots of updates! First, I created the "core" repository which is a working install (and glimpse into future work) of the management software. Now I feel as though some components should be optional/serarated, so its time to work on that. Additionally, I have some names for the projects, the first being "Nebula". You can find out more by reading any of the nebula-* repositories. Also no, there is still no documentation. This is due to a few changes in the scope of the project, but when Nebula releases in 1.0 it will include all documentation necessary to run the server manager. For now, I am working on splitting the previous "core" build into a functional core and extensions, as well as moving the install script into its own repository.

**Work has begun on server management software!**\
After a long hiatus I've finally resumed work on this project. Currently working on the core of 1.0 server mangement software. More updates to come...

**Website 1.0 Release!**\
We have finally deployed whitelist scripts to a server, allowing it to have a database managed whitelist!!!\
For now I'm taking a bit of a break from development of the backend to test deployment on modded platforms and get caught up on documentation, but then its back on the grind to release a 1.0 version of the whitelist/server software once everything is stable. Then I enter the "2.0" phase of development, where I can hopefully make a "full suite" of software similar to the stuff I have created to run my own servers off a central database. Would be really cool to make a full "control center", but that's best saved for a future "3.0" or something...\
Either way, the project continues.
